# Changes Applied - DAT409 Workshop Enhancement

## Summary
Applied expert-level refinements to align workshop content with 400-level abstract requirements, emphasizing MCP's shift from RAG to structured, context-aware retrieval.

---

## 1. Streamlit App - Tab 4 Key Takeaways

### Key Insight Update
**Before:**
```markdown
ðŸŽ¯ **Key Insight:** MCP enables agents to intelligently choose retrieval strategies based on query type, 
rather than forcing all queries through the same embedding pipeline.
```

**After:**
```markdown
ðŸŽ¯ **Key Insight:** MCP shifts from relevance-based retrieval (RAG) to structured, queryable, context-rich inputs. Agents dynamically select retrieval strategies (vector, keyword, SQL filters) based on query intentâ€”enabling time-based, persona-based, and operational context filtering impossible with static embeddings alone.
```

**File:** `demo-app/streamlit_app.py`

---

## 2. Jupyter Notebook - TODO Block Context

**Added MCP context to each TODO block:**

- **TODO 1 (Fuzzy):** ðŸ’¡ Enables agents to handle user input errors without re-promptingâ€”critical for conversational AI workflows.
- **TODO 2 (Semantic):** ðŸ’¡ Captures conceptual intent ("eco-friendly products") beyond keyword matchingâ€”the foundation of RAG, now enhanced with structured filters.
- **TODO 3 (Hybrid RRF):** ðŸ’¡ Combines multiple retrieval signals (semantic + keyword + fuzzy) without ML overheadâ€”enabling sub-100ms responses for agentic workflows.

**File:** `workshop/notebooks/dat409-hybrid-search-TODO.ipynb`

## 3. Streamlit App - Reranking Section Placement

**Moved** "Reranking: Cohere vs Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)" from Tab 3 (Advanced Analysis - Optional) to Tab 4 (Key Takeaways).

- Now first section in Tab 4
- Updated caption: "Critical production decision for 400-level architects"
- Ensures all participants see this essential comparison

**File:** `demo-app/streamlit_app.py`

---

## 4. Time-Based Filtering Example (NEW)

**Added in Tab 1** after RLS explanation:

```python
st.info("ðŸ’¡ **Time-Based Filtering:** MCP agents can combine persona and temporal filters: `WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days' AND 'support_agent' = ANY(persona_access)`")
```

**Why:** Demonstrates temporal context filtering mentioned in abstract.

**File:** `demo-app/streamlit_app.py`

---

## 5. Structured Query Filters Example (NEW)

**Added in Tab 4** after MCP Key Insight section:

Shows side-by-side comparison:
- **Traditional RAG:** Only embedding similarity (no filters)
- **MCP-Enabled:** Structured filters (price, category, rating) + vectors

```sql
-- MCP-Enabled Search
WHERE price BETWEEN 50 AND 200
  AND category_name = 'Electronics'
  AND stars >= 4.0
ORDER BY embedding <=> query_vector
```

**Why:** Shows how MCP enables structured queries (SQL WHERE clauses) that RAG cannot handle.

**File:** `demo-app/streamlit_app.py`

---

## 6. README.md Complete Rewrite (NEW)

**Completely rewrote README.md** with:
- Expert-level language matching 400-level abstract
- Accurate structure (single lab + demo app)
- "Beyond RAG" narrative throughout
- Production decision frameworks
- Condensed and tighter content

**File:** `README.md`

## Impact Assessment

### Alignment with Abstract âœ…
- âœ… Emphasizes "MCP shifts from relevance-based retrieval (RAG)"
- âœ… Highlights "structured, queryable, context-rich inputs"
- âœ… Demonstrates "time-based, persona-based, operational context filtering"
- âœ… Shows "dynamic retrieval strategy selection"
- âœ… Cohere Rerank prominently featured
- âœ… **Time-based filtering** explicitly shown
- âœ… **Query filters** explicitly demonstrated

### 400-Level Depth âœ…
- âœ… Explains WHY each method matters (not just HOW)
- âœ… Connects technical implementation to production patterns
- âœ… Reinforces MCP > RAG narrative throughout
- âœ… Critical production decisions in main content
- âœ… Structured query examples show MCP advantages

### Participant Experience âœ…
- âœ… Clear motivation for each TODO block
- âœ… Stronger connection between labs and real-world AI agents
- âœ… Consistent messaging across notebook and demo app
- âœ… All participants see reranking comparison
- âœ… Time-based and structured filter examples visible

---

## Files Modified

1. **demo-app/streamlit_app.py** - Updated Key Insight + Moved Reranking + Added time-based and structured filter examples
2. **workshop/notebooks/dat409-hybrid-search-TODO.ipynb** - Added MCP context to TODO blocks
3. **README.md** - Complete rewrite with expert-level language and accurate structure

---

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Notebook:** Open `dat409-hybrid-search-TODO.ipynb` and verify TODO sections display correctly
2. **Streamlit Tab 1:** Check time-based filtering callout appears after RLS explanation
3. **Streamlit Tab 4:** Verify Reranking section is first, followed by structured query filters comparison
4. **README:** Confirm structure matches actual repository layout

---

## Conclusion

âœ… **All Changes Applied Successfully**

The workshop now has:
- Stronger MCP vs RAG narrative
- Clear motivation for each technical component
- Consistent expert-level messaging
- Direct alignment with abstract requirements
- Critical production decisions in main content
- **Time-based filtering** explicitly demonstrated
- **Structured query filters** with RAG comparison

**Status:** Ready for re:Invent 2025 ðŸš€
